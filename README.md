A basic biological simulator. It simulates dots that move randomly and have children.
It has a naive representation of DNA, food and disease.
Colors are used to show the presence of appearance controlling genes.

The primary purpose is to show how populations that are separated by distance separate into distinct groups.
It additionally shows how groups tend to form around food sources, and how disease is limited by the population density.
